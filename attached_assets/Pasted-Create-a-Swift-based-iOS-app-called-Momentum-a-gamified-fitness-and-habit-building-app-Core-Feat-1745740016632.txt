Create a Swift-based iOS app called Momentum â€” a gamified fitness and habit-building app.

Core Features:

Personalized Habit Tracking:

Allow users to set daily, weekly, or monthly habits.

Users should be able to mark habits as complete and track their streaks.

Include reminders/notifications for habits.

Visualize habit streaks and success rates using progress graphs (charts and stats).

Motivational System:

Display motivational quotes when users open the app or complete a habit.

Unlockable "milestone achievements" based on progress.

Gamification Layer (Duolingo/Chess.com style):

Implement levels, XP points, badges, and challenges.

Introduce streak-saving features ("Momentum boosts") for missed days.

Leaderboards showing consistency levels in different divisions (Bronze, Silver, Gold, etc.).

Community Feature:

Users can join or create "Consistency Divisions" similar to Chess.com clubs.

Basic community feed: post milestones, cheer for others, etc.

Apple Watch Integration:

Enable live tracking of habits directly from Apple Watch.

Send water intake reminders and allow quick logging via Watch.

Show progress rings for daily goals on Watch face.

Reminders & Notifications:

Smart reminders based on user preference and habit schedules.

Push notifications with encouraging messages if a habit is incomplete near the deadline.

Firebase Backend:

Use Firebase Authentication (Email, Apple Sign-In, Google).

Firestore database to store:

User profiles, habits, habit logs, achievements, community posts, and leaderboard data.

Firebase Cloud Messaging for reminders and motivational notifications.

Firebase Storage for optional profile pictures.

Optional: Firebase Functions for gamification logic (XP, level-ups, rewards distribution).

Design Notes:

Clean, minimalistic, energetic aesthetic (white background, vibrant colors for progress, soft animations).

Friendly, motivational tone throughout the app.

Devices:

iPhone and Apple Watch (WatchOS support).

Other:

Local data caching to allow offline habit tracking.

Seamless sync across devices via Firebase.
